# Aethra

Aethra is a co-creative musical system developed in Pure Data (Pd) that redefines the relationship between a live performer and "fixed" electroacoustic media. By leveraging the RAVE (Real-time Audio Variational AutoEncoder) model, Aethra transforms static audio files—such as a pre-recorded tape or electronic score—into a dynamic, navigable 16-dimensional latent manifold.

This system allows performers to engage in a real-time dialogue with the electronic component, navigating through timbral and structural variations using motion-aware sampling and distance-based logic.

## Core Features

* Dynamic Latent Navigation: Move beyond linear playback. Aethra uses a one-knob control interface ($C$ value) to steer the synthesis from absolute fidelity to the original score ($C=0$) toward radical structural and timbral deviation ($C=1$).
* Motion-Aware Sampling: The system identifies and generates musical variations based on a taxonomy of Parallel, Oblique, and Contrary motions, ensuring that the electronic response remains morphologically consistent with the performer’s gestures.
* Neural Interaction via py4pd: Built using the py4pd library, Aethra seamlessly integrates Python-based machine learning (NumPy, SciPy, HMMlearn) into the real-time Pure Data environment.
* Custom Pd Objects:
  * py.load_latent: Initializes and manages the high-dimensional latent space.
  * py.coreChoice: A decision engine that implements k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for predictive navigation.
* Real-time Visualization: Integrated support for TouchDesigner (or other OSC real-time visualization tools) to provide visual feedback of latent space activations, offering a multisensory experience of the co-improvisation process.

## Technical Architecture

Aethra utilizes the py4pd objects to host and manipulate the latent space projections of RAVE models' fixed audio tapes within Pure Data. The navigation logic is abstracted into a "topological map" where Euclidean and Cosine distances determine the proximity of sampled units. To maintain musical flow during high-divergence navigation, the system employs Trajectory Alignment, preventing the rhythmic and timbral artifacts often found in standard concatenative synthesis.

## Use Cases

Aethra was first premiered in the performance "Echoes of the Unseen," where it acted as an autonomous improvisational partner for tenor saxophone, based on a reinterpretation of Jesús Villa-Rojo’s Lamento. 
It is also designed for:

* Mixed Music Performance: Liberating the performer from the "click-track" constraint of traditional tape pieces.
* Jazz Co-Improvisation: Navigating standard corpora to provide stylistically aware accompaniment.
* Sound Design: Exploring the latent intersections in a fixed soundscape to generate real-time, adaptive soundscapes.

##  Requirements
Pure Data (compiled with py4pd support, at version 1.0.2), tested on PD version 0.56.2
Python 3.13 (with numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, and hmmlearn, installed within the patch)
