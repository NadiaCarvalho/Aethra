# Aethra

Aethra is a co-creative musical system developed in Pure Data (Pd) that redefines the relationship between a live performer and "fixed" electroacoustic media. By leveraging the RAVE (Real-time Audio Variational AutoEncoder) model, Aethra transforms static audio files—such as a pre-recorded tape or electronic score—into a dynamic, navigable 16-dimensional latent manifold.

This system allows performers to engage in a real-time dialogue with the electronic component, navigating through timbral and structural variations using motion-aware sampling and distance-based logic.

## Core Features

* Dynamic Latent Navigation: Move beyond linear playback. Aethra uses a one-knob control interface ($C$ value) to steer the synthesis from absolute fidelity to the original score ($C=0$) toward radical structural and timbral deviation ($C=1$).
